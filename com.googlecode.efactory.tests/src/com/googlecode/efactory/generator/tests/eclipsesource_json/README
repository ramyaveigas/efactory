This is from https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json/
(as of Git rev. 61223004a97ef350073c63b245dc0a2e979ad787)

Copy/pasted here just to avoid an external build dependency.
It's exactly as on Git, except that package name was refactored.

This is instead of the earlier use of http://www.json.org/java/index.html
which was replaced by this based on the discussion in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425671
